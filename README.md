  Easily stored in the trunk or under a seat, deploys in minutes.

- **Emergency EV Recharge**  
  Generates enough power to give a vehicle limited range to reach safety or a charging station.

- **Off-Grid Utility**  
  Can charge auxiliary batteries, emergency lights, or small electronics in wilderness or power outage scenarios.

- **Modular and Expandable**  
  Designed to be daisy-chained with other blankets for increased output.

- **Multi-Surface Design**  
  Drapes over vehicle roofs, hoods, or lays flat on the ground depending on sunlight angle.

## ⚡ Use Cases

- EV owners stranded without charging infrastructure
- Off-grid road trips or camping
- Emergency preparedness kits for rural or winter driving
- Disaster relief, remote fleets, or government vehicle support

## 🛠️ Technology Concepts

- Ultra-thin, flexible solar cells (e.g., CIGS, perovskite)
- Weather-resistant folding panels
- Optional built-in charge controller and inverter
- Compact carrying case with tethered leads

## 🌍 Vision

SolarSave represents the missing link between solar-powered vehicles and emergency readiness. With expanding EV adoption and climate instability, this concept offers peace of mind and safety through renewable power — anywhere, anytime.
